## 2024-05-18 - Added ARIA labels to header icons
**Learning:** Replaced icon-only `<svg>` elements with semantic `<button>` elements possessing `aria-label`s ("Search" and "Menu"). To prevent breaking the visual layout and maintaining consistency with the previous `div`/`svg` based structure, CSS resets (`background: none; border: none; padding: 0; color: inherit;`) were applied to the new buttons in `.header-icon` classes. Also, needed to update JavaScript selectors (e.g., in `app/src/ui/menu.ts`) to target the new `button[aria-label="Menu"]` instead of structural pseudo-classes (`.header-icon:last-child`) which became fragile.
**Action:** Always wrap interactive SVG icons in standard `<button>` tags with `aria-label`s. Ensure default button styles are reset to match design expectations, and prefer attribute-based selectors in JS/TS for robustness.
